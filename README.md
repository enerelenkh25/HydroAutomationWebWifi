The GitHub repository "HydroAutomationWebWifi" includes documentation for a thesis project that integrates Arduino, JavaScript (JS), and HTML to facilitate Wi-Fi connectivity for web-based hydroponic automation systems. The code in the repository primarily focuses on connecting hydroponic system controls to a user interface via Wi-Fi, enabling remote management and monitoring of hydroponic conditions. This setup allows for real-time data exchange between the hardware (Arduino) and the web interface, enhancing the accessibility and usability of hydroponic systems.
